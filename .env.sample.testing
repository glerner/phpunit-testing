# Test Groups -- Future Enhancement
# Define groups of tests that can be run together with the --group option
# Faster execution than running all tests in the project
# Use wildcards (*) to include multiple test files without listing each one
# Format: INI-style sections with one path per line

# Uncomment and customize these examples when implementing the --group feature
