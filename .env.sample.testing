# Testing Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.testing and customize for your environment


# WordPress Path Configurations - REQUIRED
# We *recommend* developing your plugin outside the WordPress installation
# and syncing it to WordPress using the sync-to-wp.php script
# These settings tell the testing framework where your WordPress installation is located

# File system location of your plugin
# Note: a shorthand like ~/sites probably won't work
# use full path like /home/USERNAME/sites/yourplugin
# Note: requiring your tests be in PLUGIN_FOLDER/tests folder
PLUGIN_FOLDER=/home/george/sites/yourplugin

# WordPress Root Path (in any application container)
# The folder that has wp-content/ and wp-includes/
# If you are within a container (e.g., Lando, Docker), use the container's address
# If you are on the host, use the path to your WordPress installation
WP_ROOT=/app

# The path to the WordPress installation on the filesystem
# - For local development: Your local WordPress path
# - For Lando: The path on your host machine, not the container path
# Without trailing slash /
FILESYSTEM_WP_ROOT=/home/USERNAME/sites/wordpress

# The folder path within WordPress where your code will be installed
# Default: wp-content/plugins (for plugins)
# Alternatives: wp-content/themes (for themes) or any custom path
# Without leading or trailing slashes
FOLDER_IN_WORDPRESS=wp-content/plugins

# The name of your plugin's directory in WordPress Plugins (wp-content/plugins/your-plugin-slug)
# This should match the folder name where your plugin is installed
# Final path will be: FILESYSTEM_WP_ROOT/FOLDER_IN_WORDPRESS/YOUR_PLUGIN_SLUG
# Without trailing slash /
YOUR_PLUGIN_SLUG=your-plugin-name

# WordPress Test Library Path (Required for integration tests)
# This is where PHPUnit expects to find the WordPress test library
# The setup script will install PHPUnit itself at:
# FILESYSTEM_WP_ROOT/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-develop/tests/phpunit
# unless specified here
# Use your full filesystem path, not container path
# e.g. WP_TESTS_DIR=/home/USERNAME/sites/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-develop/tests/phpunit
# WP_TESTS_DIR=

# PHPUnit Database Configuration
# These settings allow you to customize the database used for PHPUnit tests
# If not specified, defaults will be used (WP database name + '_test' and WP table prefix)
# The user, password, host database connection parameters could be the same as for your WordPress database.
# The test database name *should be different* than the WordPress database name; you will be wiping out the wordpress_test database often when you run the tests.

# Custom database name for PHPUnit tests
# default WP_TESTS_DB_NAME=wordpress_test
WP_TESTS_DB_NAME=wordpress_test_yourplugin

# Custom table prefix for PHPUnit tests
# Useful when testing multiple plugins in the same WordPress installation
# Should end in _
WP_TESTS_TABLE_PREFIX=yourplugin_test_

# SSH Command Configuration
# The setup script needs to access both the filesystem and database
# This setting determines how database commands are executed
#
# Common options:
#   none - Run database commands directly (local development with direct DB access)
#   lando ssh - Use Lando to access the database (recommended for Lando environments)
#   ssh user@host - Connect to a remote server (for remote/staging environments)
#   ssh - Already in an SSH session with DB access (don't launch another SSH session)
#
# For local development with tools like Local by Flywheel, XAMPP, or MAMP, use 'none'
SSH_COMMAND=none

# WordPress Test Database Configuration (for integration tests)
# (database name configured above)
WP_TESTS_DB_USER=wordpress
WP_TESTS_DB_PASSWORD=wordpress
WP_TESTS_DB_HOST=database

# WordPress Test Site Configuration (for integration tests)
WP_TESTS_DOMAIN=example.org
WP_TESTS_EMAIL=admin@example.org
WP_TESTS_TITLE="Test Blog"
WP_TESTS_NETWORK_TITLE="Test Network"
WP_TESTS_SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL=1

# Code Coverage Settings
COVERAGE_REPORT_PATH=build/coverage
CLOVER_REPORT_PATH=build/logs/clover.xml

# Test Groups -- Future Enhancement
# Define groups of tests that can be run together with the --group option
# Faster execution than running all tests in the project
# Use wildcards (*) to include multiple test files without listing each one
# Format: INI-style sections with one path per line

# Uncomment and customize these examples when implementing the --group feature
