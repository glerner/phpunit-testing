# UI Testing Tools Overview for WordPress/PHP Projects

## Can an AI Agent click a button on a webpage form, by the element's CSS class?
Yes. Automated testing tools (Selenium, Playwright, Cypress) can simulate clicks and select elements by CSS class. Example (JavaScript, Puppeteer):

```js
await page.click('.your-button-class');
```

Example (PHP, Selenium):
```php
$driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::className('your-button-class'))->click();
```

---

## Can I test a user interface by automating clicking on a button?
Yes. UI testing frameworks let you script browser actions (clicks, typing, etc.) for end-to-end or functional testing.

---

## Can I test a website being up by checking the presence of a link or JavaScript button?
Yes. You can automate a browser to load a page and check for the presence of specific elements (e.g., `<ul><li><a role="button">`). Example (Playwright, Node.js):

```js
const button = await page.$('ul li a[role="button"]');
if (button) { /* present */ }
```

---

## Are Selenium, Playwright, Cypress free and easy to install?
- **All three are free and open source.**
- **Selenium:** Oldest, supports many languages (incl. PHP), more setup.
- **Playwright:** Modern, easy to use, focused on Node.js/JS but supports others.
- **Cypress:** Modern, very easy for JS, focused on Chrome-family browsers.

Install examples:
- Playwright: `npm install -D playwright`
- Cypress: `npm install -D cypress`
- Selenium (Python): `pip install selenium`

---

## Can I do simpler tests with just PHP and JavaScript?
- **PHP:** Can check if a site is up (e.g., with `file_get_contents()` or `curl`), but cannot interact with JS-rendered content or simulate real browser actions.
- **JavaScript (Node.js):** Can use `fetch` or `axios` for simple checks. For real user simulation, use Puppeteer/Playwright.

## UI Testing Tools Comparison

**Selenium**
- Supports all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)
- Scripting in many languages (PHP, JS, Python, Java, etc.)
- Large, mature community and docs
- More setup/boilerplate, older API style
- PHP support is a plus for WordPress/PHP devs

**Playwright**
- Supports Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit (Safari)
- Modern, concise API
- Scripting in JavaScript (Node.js), Python, Java, .NET
- Fast, reliable, and feature-rich
- Great for cross-browser testing
- Not tied to Microsoft/.NET (Node.js is primary)

**Cypress**
- Supports Chrome-family browsers (Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Brave, Electron)
- Experimental Firefox support (not as mature)
- Scripting in JavaScript (Node.js)
- Very easy setup and modern API
- Best for front-end JS/UI testing

**Puppeteer**
- Supports Chrome/Chromium and Brave only
- Scripting in JavaScript (Node.js)
- Easy to use, fast, and great for headless browser automation
- Similar to Playwright for basic tasks, but Playwright supports more browsers and advanced features
- Good choice if you only need Chrome/Chromium/Brave

## When to Add JavaScript Testing and Code Quality Tools to a WordPress Project

If your WordPress plugin or theme contains significant JavaScript (custom admin UI, Gutenberg blocks, AJAX, or uses JS libraries), you should add JavaScript code quality and browser testing tools to your project. This complements your PHP testing setup and ensures:
- Consistent code style and fewer JS bugs
- Automated UI/E2E (user interface, end-to-end) tests for JS-driven features
- Parity with your robust PHP code quality tools

---

## JavaScript Equivalents to PHPCS and PHPStan

- **PHPCS (PHP CodeSniffer)** -→ **ESLint** (for JS/TS)
  - Checks code style, formatting, and enforces best practices
  - Highly configurable with plugins and rulesets
- **Prettier**
  - Automatic code formatter for JS/TS/JSON/CSS/HTML
  - Works alongside ESLint for consistent style
- **PHPStan** (static analysis) -→ **ESLint** (with static analysis rules) and **TypeScript** (`tsc`) if using TypeScript
  - Finds bugs, type errors, and code smells

### Recommended JavaScript Tools
- **ESLint:** Linting and static analysis
- **Prettier:** Code formatting
- **Jest** or **Mocha:** Unit testing for JS logic
- **Playwright** or **Puppeteer:** Browser/E2E testing for UI and workflows

---

## Summary: PHP and JavaScript Code Quality & Testing Tools

**For PHP:**
- PHPUnit: Unit and integration testing
- PHPCS: Code style and formatting
- PHPStan: Static analysis

**For JavaScript:**
- ESLint: Linting, code style, and static analysis
- Prettier: Code formatting
- Jest/Mocha: Unit testing
- Playwright/Puppeteer/Cypress/Selenium: Browser automation and E2E testing

---

**Tip:**
- Add ESLint and Prettier if your plugin/theme includes custom JS.
- Add Playwright or Puppeteer for automated browser tests if you have JS-driven UI or workflows.
- This gives you full coverage for both PHP and JS code quality and testing!

## Automating WordPress Plugin Updates and Logging Results

Browser automation tools (Selenium, Playwright, Puppeteer, Cypress) can automate workflows like updating plugins in WordPress and logging results. Example tasks you can automate:

- Log in to `/wp-admin`.
- Navigate to the Plugins page.
- Click "Update" for plugins.
- Read and parse update result messages (e.g., "Site Kit by Google updated successfully from version 1.151.0 to version 1.153.0").
- Log results such as:
  - Plugin name, old version, new version.
  - Success/failure messages.
  - Special cases (blocked, not in repository, etc.).

**Example (Playwright/Puppeteer, pseudocode):**
```js
// 1. Log in to wp-admin
// 2. Go to plugins.php
// 3. For each plugin with an update, click update
// 4. Wait for result message, scrape text, log it
// 5. Repeat for all plugins
```

**This approach works with all major browser automation tools.**

---

## Recommendations
- Use **PHPUnit**, **PHPCS**, **PHPStan** for PHP code quality (best for PHP/WordPress).
- Use **Node.js tools** (Jest, ESLint, etc.) for JavaScript code only.
- For browser automation (UI/E2E tests):
  - **Playwright** or **Cypress**: Easy setup, modern, concise scripts (requires some JS).
  - **Selenium**: PHP support, but more setup and less ergonomic.
- **Playwright is not tied to .NET or Microsoft tech**—works fine for WordPress sites.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Node.js tools for PHP code?**
A: No, use PHP tools for PHP code. Node.js tools are for JS/TS code.

**Q: Is Playwright only for Microsoft/.NET?**
A: No, it works with Node.js/JS and supports all websites, including WordPress.

**Q: Are all three tools similar if AI writes the scripts?**
A: Playwright and Cypress are easier to read and maintain. Selenium is more verbose, especially in PHP, but all can automate browser actions.

---

## Example: Simple Playwright Test for WordPress Site

```js
// Install: npm install -D playwright
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://yourwordpresssite.com');
  const button = await page.$('ul li a[role="button"]');
  if (button) {
    console.log('Button is present!');
  } else {
    console.log('Button not found.');
  }
  await browser.close();
})();
```

**For more examples or setup help, ask for a minimal script in your preferred language!**

## FAQ: PHP vs. JS for Testing and Browser Automation

**Is Playwright vs. Puppeteer mainly about Firefox support?**
- The biggest difference is browser support: Puppeteer supports only Chrome/Chromium (and Brave), while Playwright supports Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit (Safari). Playwright also has more advanced features for cross-browser automation, but for most basic tasks, they are very similar.

**Why use Selenium instead of PHPUnit for PHP projects?**
- PHPUnit is for testing PHP code directly (functions, classes, backend logic). Selenium is for simulating real user actions in a browser and testing the full stack (PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, browser). Use Selenium (or Playwright, etc.) for end-to-end or UI testing, not for unit testing PHP logic.

**What is the benefit of writing browser tests in PHP (with Selenium)?**
- You can keep all your tests in PHP, which may be convenient if your team only knows PHP. However, the browser automation ecosystem is more modern and feature-rich in JavaScript (with Playwright, Cypress, or Puppeteer). Most teams use PHPUnit for PHP logic and JS-based tools for browser tests.

**What is TypeScript and what does tsc do?**
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types. `tsc` is the TypeScript compiler; it checks for type errors and compiles TypeScript files (`.ts`) to JavaScript. You only use TypeScript and `tsc` if you choose to write your JavaScript in TypeScript.
