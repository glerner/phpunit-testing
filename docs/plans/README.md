# Plans Directory

This directory contains both active and completed plans for the PHPUnit Testing Framework project.

## Naming Convention

- **Completed Plans**: `YYYY-MM-DD-Plan-Name.md` (with date prefix)
- **Active Plans**: `plan-name.md` (no date prefix)

## Plan Structure

Each plan should include:

1. **Title and Overview**
2. **Status**: Active or Completed
3. **Files Modified**: List of files that were changed
4. **Original Task**: Description of the original task or request
5. **Steps**: Checklist of steps to complete the task
6. **Summary of Changes**: Brief summary of what was accomplished

## Using Plans for Commit Messages

Plans provide an excellent source for creating meaningful commit messages:
- Review the completed plan before committing changes
- Extract key points for the commit message
- Consider referencing the plan in the commit message

## Guidelines

- Create a plan for any significant task that involves multiple changes
- Update plans as you progress through tasks
- When a plan is completed, rename it with the date prefix
- Use plans to document your thought process and decisions
